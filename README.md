# FastAPI Talking to Redis

This project currently demonstrates communication between a Python FastAPI application and a dockerized Redis instance. 

The intent of this project is to learn how to leverage `heroku.yml` with these applications.

Our application leverages [this docker image](https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-docker) for quick hosting.
